# Customer Attrition Prediction 

### This basically deals with a banking compnay who is analysing it's client data by checking which are existing customer and which are attrited(discontinued using it's services)
and based on this pattern they needed to look for people who will become attrited in the near future.I did this using some help from kaggle dataset on customer_attrition_prediction.
The dataset was quite similar to this and the code really helped me in following my approach.

## The code is open to any kind of contribution you find suitable.
